## 📁 Services Overview

### Invoice Generation and Orchestration

#### InvoiceGenerationService
Generates invoices for leases with support for rent, recurring charges, and future utility billing.

**Features**:
- Generates invoices for a specific lease and billing period
- Implements idempotency by updating existing draft invoices
- Prevents regeneration of issued or voided invoices
- Calculates due dates based on billing settings
- Automatically generates rent and recurring charge lines
- Calculates totals and tax amounts

**Example**:
```csharp
var service = new InvoiceGenerationService(/* dependencies */);
var result = await service.GenerateInvoiceAsync(
    leaseId: leaseGuid,
    billingPeriodStart: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1),
    billingPeriodEnd: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31),
    prorationMethod: ProrationMethod.ActualDaysInMonth
);

if (result.IsSuccess)
{
    var invoice = result.Invoice;
    Console.WriteLine($"Invoice {invoice.InvoiceNumber} generated");
    Console.WriteLine($"Total: {invoice.TotalAmount:C}");
}
```

#### InvoiceRunService
Orchestrates batch invoice generation for multiple leases.

**Features**:
- Executes monthly rent billing runs across all active leases
- Handles partial failures with per-lease error tracking
- Logs run results with InvoiceRunItem records
- Supports both monthly rent and utility billing runs

**Example**:
```csharp
var service = new InvoiceRunService(/* dependencies */);
var result = await service.ExecuteMonthlyRentRunAsync(
    orgId: organizationGuid,
    billingPeriodStart: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1),
    billingPeriodEnd: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31),
    prorationMethod: ProrationMethod.ActualDaysInMonth
);

Console.WriteLine($"Run completed: {result.SuccessCount} succeeded, {result.FailureCount} failed");
```

#### InvoiceManagementService
Manages invoice lifecycle operations including issuing and voiding invoices.

**Features**:
- Issues invoices (Draft → Issued) and sets IssuedAtUtc timestamp
- Validates invoices before issuing (must have lines, positive total)
- Prevents edits to issued invoices
- Voids invoices with reason tracking
- Prevents voiding of paid invoices

**Example**:
```csharp
var service = new InvoiceManagementService(/* dependencies */);

// Issue an invoice
var issueResult = await service.IssueInvoiceAsync(invoiceId);
if (issueResult.IsSuccess)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Invoice issued at {issueResult.Invoice.IssuedAtUtc}");
}

// Void an invoice
var voidResult = await service.VoidInvoiceAsync(invoiceId, "Customer requested cancellation");
if (voidResult.IsSuccess)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Invoice voided: {voidResult.Invoice.VoidReason}");
}
```

#### CreditNoteService
Manages credit note creation and issuance workflows.

**Features**:
- Creates credit notes with negative line items
- Validates credit amounts against invoice lines
- Issues credit notes (marks as applied)
- Supports multiple credit note reasons (discount, refund, adjustment, etc.)
- Prevents credit notes for draft or voided invoices

**Example**:
```csharp
var service = new CreditNoteService(/* dependencies */);

// Create credit note
var lineItems = new List<CreditNoteLineRequest>
{
    new CreditNoteLineRequest 
    { 
        InvoiceLineId = invoiceLineGuid, 
        Amount = 500m,
        Notes = "Partial refund" 
    }
};

var createResult = await service.CreateCreditNoteAsync(
    invoiceId: invoiceGuid,
    reason: CreditNoteReason.Refund,
    lineItems: lineItems,
    notes: "Customer requested partial refund"
);

if (createResult.IsSuccess)
{
    // Issue the credit note
    var issueResult = await service.IssueCreditNoteAsync(createResult.CreditNote.Id);
    Console.WriteLine($"Credit note {createResult.CreditNote.CreditNoteNumber} issued");
}
```

### Proration Calculators

#### ActualDaysInMonthCalculator
Calculates prorated amounts using the actual number of days in a calendar month (28-31 days).

**Formula**: `(DaysUsed / TotalDaysInPeriod) × FullAmount`

**Example**:
```csharp
var calculator = new ActualDaysInMonthCalculator();
var prorated = calculator.CalculateProration(
    fullAmount: 10000m,
    startDate: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 15),
    endDate: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31),
    billingPeriodStart: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1),
    billingPeriodEnd: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31)
);
// Result: 5483.87 (17 days out of 31)
```

#### ThirtyDayMonthCalculator
Calculates prorated amounts using a fixed 30-day month regardless of actual calendar days.

**Formula**: `(DaysUsed / 30) × FullAmount`

**Example**:
```csharp
var calculator = new ThirtyDayMonthCalculator();
var prorated = calculator.CalculateProration(
    fullAmount: 10000m,
    startDate: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 15),
    endDate: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31),
    billingPeriodStart: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1),
    billingPeriodEnd: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31)
);
// Result: 5666.67 (17 actual days / 30)
```

---

### Rent Calculation Service

Calculates rent for a lease period, handling:
- Multiple lease terms (versioned terms)
- Mid-period rent changes with automatic proration
- Different billing frequencies

**Example**:
```csharp
var service = new RentCalculationService(leaseRepository);
var result = await service.CalculateRentAsync(
    leaseId: leaseGuid,
    billingPeriodStart: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1),
    billingPeriodEnd: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31),
    prorationMethod: ProrationMethod.ActualDaysInMonth
);

// Result includes line items for each term period
// e.g., Jan 1-15 at $10,000/mo = $4,838.71
//       Jan 16-31 at $12,000/mo = $6,193.55
```

---

### Recurring Charge Calculation Service

Calculates recurring charges (maintenance fees, parking, etc.) with proration support.

**Features**:
- Handles charges that start or end mid-period
- Supports different billing frequencies (monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Automatically prorates based on effective dates

**Example**:
```csharp
var service = new RecurringChargeCalculationService(recurringChargeRepository);
var result = await service.CalculateChargesAsync(
    leaseId: leaseGuid,
    billingPeriodStart: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 1),
    billingPeriodEnd: new DateOnly(2024, 1, 31),
    prorationMethod: ProrationMethod.ActualDaysInMonth
);

// Result includes all active recurring charges prorated if needed
```

---

### Utility Calculation Service

Calculates utility charges with three modes:

#### 1. Amount-Based (Direct Billing)
```csharp
var service = new UtilityCalculationService(ratePlanRepository);
var result = service.CalculateAmountBased(
    amount: 1500m,
    utilityType: UtilityType.Electricity
);
// Direct pass-through of utility bill amount
```

#### 2. Meter-Based with Flat Rate
```csharp
var result = service.CalculateMeterBasedFlatRate(
    unitsConsumed: 250m,
    ratePerUnit: 5.50m,
    fixedCharge: 50m,
    utilityType: UtilityType.Electricity
);
// Result: (250 × 5.50) + 50 = 1425.00
```

#### 3. Meter-Based with Slabs
```csharp
var result = await service.CalculateMeterBasedSlabsAsync(
    unitsConsumed: 350m,
    ratePlanId: ratePlanGuid,
    utilityType: UtilityType.Electricity
);
// Calculates using tiered rates:
// 0-100 units @ $3/unit = $300
// 101-200 units @ $4/unit = $400
// 201-350 units @ $5/unit = $750
// Total: $1450
```

### Number Generation Services

Thread-safe services for generating unique invoice and credit note numbers.

#### Invoice Number Generator
```csharp
var generator = new InvoiceNumberGenerator(numberSequenceRepository);
var invoiceNumber = await generator.GenerateNextAsync(
    orgId: organizationGuid,
    prefix: "INV" // Optional, defaults to "INV"
);
// Result: "INV-202601-000042"
```

#### Credit Note Number Generator
```csharp
var generator = new CreditNoteNumberGenerator(numberSequenceRepository);
var creditNoteNumber = await generator.GenerateNextAsync(
    orgId: organizationGuid,
    prefix: "CN" // Optional, defaults to "CN"
);
// Result: "CN-202601-000015"
```

**Number Format**: `{PREFIX}-{YYYYMM}-{NNNNNN}`
- PREFIX: Customizable prefix (default: INV or CN)
- YYYYMM: Year and month
- NNNNNN: 6-digit sequence number (padded with zeros)

## 📝 Design Decisions

### Proration Methods
Two methods are provided to accommodate different business requirements:
- **Actual Days**: More accurate for short-term rentals or varying month lengths
- **30-Day Month**: Simplified calculation, consistent across all months

### Rounding
All monetary calculations round to 2 decimal places using `MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero` for consistency.

### Thread Safety
Number generators rely on repository-level locking to ensure uniqueness across concurrent requests.

### Immutability
Result objects are designed as records or with init-only properties to ensure calculation results cannot be modified after creation.

## 🚀 Usage in Billing Engine

These services are building blocks for the billing engine and should be used by:
1. **Invoice Generation** - Combine rent, recurring charges, and utilities
2. **Invoice Lifecycle** - Issue invoices to finalize them, void for cancellations
3. **Credit Notes** - Calculate refunds and adjustments with proration
4. **Billing Previews** - Show tenants upcoming charges
5. **Reporting** - Generate financial reports

### Invoice Lifecycle Workflow

```
Draft → Issue → (Paid | Overdue | PartiallyPaid)
  ↓
  └→ Void (with reason)
  
Issued/Paid → CreditNote (for refunds/adjustments)
```

### State Transition Rules

- **Draft**: Can be edited, regenerated, or deleted
- **Issued**: Immutable, can be voided (if unpaid) or credited
- **Voided**: Terminal state, cannot be changed
- **Paid/PartiallyPaid**: Can only be credited, not voided
